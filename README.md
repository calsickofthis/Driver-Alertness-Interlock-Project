<h1>Project Introduction</h1>
Late last year I was involved in a TikTok Campaign for road safety with the Road Safety Authority (RSA), I had the opportunity to speak to the RSA’s Director of Partnerships & External Affairs, and we got into a discussion about how software could help ensure drivers are driving safely and are alert at the wheel. I’d already been thinking about what to do on my project - after some thought, after the conversation I decided to go with this project.


<h2>What does DigiDrive do?</h2>


DigiDrive uses two web cameras facing placed at a view to the driver - its purpose is to judge two things:

1. Whether the driver’s eyes are open
2. Where the user’s view-field is as they look out the window of the car.
In the case where the driver shuts their eyes for longer than 2 seconds - they will be given a penalty point, as well as this if the driver faces their head to their lap - they’ll receive another penalty point. If the user receives more than a certain amount of these penalty points the traffic light on the dashboard will turn yellow, if they receive another certain amount of the penalty points, the traffic light will turn red.

<h2>Motivation for this Project</h2>
Last year, I participated in a TikTok campaign focused on road safety in collaboration with the Road Safety Authority (RSA). During this campaign, I had the privilege of engaging in a conversation with the RSA’s Director of Partnerships & External Affairs. Our discussion delved into the potential of software solutions in promoting safe driving practices and ensuring drivers remain attentive behind the wheel.

Reflecting on our conversation, I found myself drawn to the idea of leveraging technology to enhance road safety. The exchange sparked a series of contemplations regarding the direction of my project. After careful consideration, I made the decision to centre my efforts on this very concept.

The notion of utilising software to foster safer driving habits resonated deeply with me. In an era dominated by technological advancements, it seems only logical to harness the power of software to address pressing issues such as road safety. The potential benefits are manifold, ranging from real-time monitoring of driver behaviour to the implementation of proactive measures to prevent accidents.

By incorporating software solutions into the realm of road safety, we have the opportunity to revolutionise the way we approach driver education and enforcement. Imagine a system capable of analysing driving patterns and providing personalised feedback to motorists, empowering them to make informed decisions and mitigate risks on the road.

Furthermore, software holds the promise of enhancing accountability among drivers. With the ability to track various metrics such as speed, acceleration, and adherence to traffic laws, we can create a culture of responsibility wherein drivers are held accountable for their actions. This, in turn, could serve as a deterrent against reckless driving behaviour, ultimately reducing the incidence of accidents.

However, while the potential benefits of integrating software into road safety initiatives are undeniable, it is essential to tread cautiously. Privacy concerns, data security, and ethical considerations must all be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible implementation of such technology.

In essence, my decision to pursue a project centred on leveraging software for road safety was inspired by a profound realisation of the transformative potential inherent in technological innovation. By harnessing the power of software, we have the opportunity to not only enhance road safety but also cultivate a culture of conscientious driving and accountability on our roads.

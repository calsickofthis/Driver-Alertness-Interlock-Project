# Driver-Alertness-Interlock-Project
This is a project for my Ppit module in my 3rd year of university - It's a piece of software that uses computer vision to analyse the drivers alertness in a vehicle - in the case where it notices the driver occur in multiple defined validations - it will lock the vehicle from starting once parked / alert authorities.
